    "A language model is an algorithm that takes a sequence of words, and outputs the likely next word in the sequence. Most language models output a list of words, each with its probability of occurance. For example, if we had a sentence that started `I would like to eat a hot`, then ideally the algorithm would predict that  the word `dog` had a much higher chance of being the next word than the word `meeting`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Language models are a very powerful building block in natural language processing. They are used for classifying text (e.g. is this review positive or negative?), for answering questions based on text (e.g. \"what is the capital of Finland?\" based on the Wikipedia page on Finland), and language translation (e.g. English to Japanese).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The intuition behind why language models are so broadly useful\n",
    "How can this simple sounding algorithm be that broadly useful? Intuitively, this is because predicting the next word in a sentence requires a lot of information, not just about grammar and syntax, but also about semantics: what things mean in the real-world. For instance, we know that `I would like to eat a hot dog` is semantically reasonable, but `I would like to eat a hot cat` is nonsensical. \n",

After experimenting a bit, I think that headlines generated with more `string_words` are more likely to not have grammatical errors. However, the headlines sometimes do not make factual sense, and aren't specific to what we may be looking for. In case of `n_words`, the more `n_words` we specify for the model to predict, the more likely it is for the model to give out unidentifiable words in the sentence such as xxbos etc or leave the sentence incomplete. Thus the optimum combination for a good headline is more `string_words` and lesser `n_words`which can be quantified after running some more experiments."

    "Answer: My interpretation: From what I read in blogs and articles, I found that a text classifier breaks apart the text into separate words and measures the effect of those words. Text classification assigns categories to text. By using TextClassificationInterpretation above, the darker the highlight for a word, the more it contributes to the classification and in our case, classification of satire. In the line above where a man takes a bike for a test ride and steals it, the parts of the sentence that make it funny include bike, test ride and steals. However, the words with the highest impact are man, takes, davidson, bike and steals. The word `test ride` which is making the sentence funny is not picked as an important keyword by the classifier, which leads to the misclassification. This can also be said for the fake funeral plan example.\n",
