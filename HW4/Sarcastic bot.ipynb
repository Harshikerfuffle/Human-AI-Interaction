    "A language model is an algorithm that takes a sequence of words, and outputs the likely next word in the sequence. Most language models output a list of words, each with its probability of occurance. For example, if we had a sentence that started `I would like to eat a hot`, then ideally the algorithm would predict that  the word `dog` had a much higher chance of being the next word than the word `meeting`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Language models are a very powerful building block in natural language processing. They are used for classifying text (e.g. is this review positive or negative?), for answering questions based on text (e.g. \"what is the capital of Finland?\" based on the Wikipedia page on Finland), and language translation (e.g. English to Japanese).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The intuition behind why language models are so broadly useful\n",
    "How can this simple sounding algorithm be that broadly useful? Intuitively, this is because predicting the next word in a sentence requires a lot of information, not just about grammar and syntax, but also about semantics: what things mean in the real-world. For instance, we know that `I would like to eat a hot dog` is semantically reasonable, but `I would like to eat a hot cat` is nonsensical. \n",
